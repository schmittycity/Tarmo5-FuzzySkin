This is a fork of the assembly made by nemesis. The files in the main folder contain a new body that intersects with the Tarmo5 body by 0.4mm so when you import into prusaslicer you can set the mesh as a modifier and create a nice fuzzy skin around the visible surfaces without disrupting the structural integrity of the part (ongoing Prusaslicer issue with using modifier shapes that intersect with the part body that put fuzzy skin inside the part body).
